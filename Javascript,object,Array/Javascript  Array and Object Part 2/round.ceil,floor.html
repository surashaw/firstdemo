Q) What is ceil and floor function and what is use of them. 

Ans: ceil: Returns the value of a given variable rounded up to its nearest integer.
     floor: Returns the value of a given variable rounded down to its nearest integer

Q)What is round and how it is different from ceil and floor.

Ans:round returns the value of a given variable rounded to its nearest integer. 
    Where as the ceil reomded ups to the neares variable and 
    floor reonded down to the neares variable.

    Example:

    Maths.rouns(7.7) will give result 8.
    Maths.ceil(7.7) will give resul 8.
    Maths.floor(7.7) will give result 7.

    This shows that both round and ceil are the same in terms of operation with a different name.
    

Q)What will be output for below codes and give reason for output.

    -> 1 + "2" + "2"
    ANs:"122" as it will considerthe number 1 as a number and rest as string and will just concat them.
    -> 1+2+3 +”4”
    Ans: "64"  as it will considerthe number 1 ,2,3 as a number and add them up and rest as string and will just concat them.
    -> “4” + true
    Ans: "4true"
    ->“True” + true
    Ans: "Truetrue"
    -> 1 + true
    Ans: 2
    -> 2 + false
    Ans: 2
    ->"4" * true
    Ans: 4
    -> 4 * “Af”
    Ans: NaN
    -> "4" * "A"
    Ans: NaN
    -> “4”*”4”
    Ans:16
    -> 4 + "4A" +10
    Ans: 44A10
    -> 4 + "4" * 10
    ANs: 44
    -> 4 + "4A" * 10
    ANs:NaN 
    -> 4 + "true" * 10
    Ans: NaN
    -> true *80
    Ans: NaN
    -> 1 +2+ 3+ "ad"
    Ans: 6ad
    -> "1" +2+ 3
    Ans: 123
    -> "1" *2+ 3+8*"true"
    Ans:NaN
    -> true*0 + "false"
    Ans: 0
    -> 1 *2+ 3+8+"true"
    Ans: NaN
    -> 1 *null + true+10 + "10"
    Ans: 1110
